# Game-of-Choice
Hi there, I am Omkar Pawar and I am on journey to be a Data Scientist. I am falling in love with coding. I can see endless possibilities for creative person like me who wants to make their own new paths. I thought about making this fun storyteller game, where your choice leads you to treasure !!! Try your luck. 
I have used my knowledge of if, elif and else conditions to create this game. We can make this game more big feel free to fork and add on to our small treasure.
